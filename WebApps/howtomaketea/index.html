      <h2>Preparation</h2> 
      <ol>
        <li>Run the tap a little to the water's nicely aereated and only boil it once to keep the oxygen level up. Oxygen in water helps flavour.  </li>
        <li>Pop a team bag into your mug (<em>always</em> a big mug)</li>
        <li>Pour the hot water over the tea bag and stir briefly.</li>
        <li>Tea needs time to unlock all its flavor, so give it 3-4 minutes to do its things. This is a perfect time to grab a sneaky cookie or daydream about vacations.</li>
        <li>Before removing the tea bag, gently squish it with a spoon against the side of the mug. Not too much or you will make it bitter.</li>
        <li>If you want, throw in some milk or sugar or honey or nothing else at all.</li>
        <li>Enjoy!</li>
      </ol>
